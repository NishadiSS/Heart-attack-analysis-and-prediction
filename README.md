## ðŸ’«Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction
This project aims to analyze heart attack data and develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart attack based on various health metrics.

### ðŸ’«Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. In this project, we analyze a dataset containing several health parameters such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and exercise habits, among others, to identify patterns and factors associated with heart attacks. We then build a machine learning model to predict the risk of a heart attack for an individual based on these parameters.

### ðŸ’«Methodology
#### Data Preprocessing: 
We start by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables as necessary.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
We perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and identify any potential patterns or anomalies in the data.
#### Feature Selection:
We use various techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, and domain knowledge to select relevant features for training the machine learning model.
#### Model Building:
We experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting to build predictive models. We optimize hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
